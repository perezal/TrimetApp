## TrimetApp

This is my first stab at a React app and web API access.

The web API I use is from the transit company Trimet that serves the Portland, Oregon area. Details about the API may be found [here](https://developer.trimet.org/ws_docs/).

Eventually I plan on adding a map interface, though my attention is currently divided between a few projects.

If you have any advice or recommendations for improvements, please don't hesitate to create an issue or contact me at [alex@alexperez.ninja](mailto:alex@alexperez.ninja).
